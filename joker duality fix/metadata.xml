    <description>If you have Duality, the game doesn't let you choose between an angel or devil room when you use a Joker card. This mod will teleport you to a new room where you can choose.

As an added bonus, red chests and Teleport 2.0 are also supported.

This mod requires REPENTOGON.</description>
